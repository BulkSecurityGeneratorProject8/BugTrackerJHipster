Please note that clicking this button will open the Google Cloud Shell in a new tab, clone the repository tutorials and start the tutorial n°0.

To run a particuliar tutorial, use this command in the Google Cloud Shell:

```bash
teachme ~/jhipster-guides/guides/foo.md"
```

If your Google Cloud Shell session expires, you will have to follow the steps in tutorial n°0 again. We've provided a minimal script that installs for you in the utils folder. You just need to run this next command in the Google Cloud Shell:

```bash
~/jhipster-guides/utils/setup.sh
